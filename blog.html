              <p>
                The first week began with a lot of tutorials (such as <a class="blogLink"
                  href="https://learngitbranching.js.org" target="_blank">Learning Git</a>) and struggling with the <a
                  class="blogLink" href="https://lab.github.com/" target="_blank">Github bot</a> and it ended with the
                setting up of <a class="blogLink" href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">MAMP</a> and <a
                  class="blogLink" href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, which were both
                new to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                The morning <a class="blogLink" href="https://www.hackerrank.com" target="_blank">Hacker Rank</a> exercises were something I was looking forward to, as I have heard that whiteboard problems are prevalent in interviews, and it is important to me to be able to learn how to work through them.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was excited when we started on our first project, a campaign page for a fictional character, in which I choseBuffy the Vampire Slayer. I had a really fun time combining all the <a class="blogLink"
                  href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> elements I learned about during the course of the week into a cohesive site (and getting to reference Buffy pictures and information). I had some elements on my page that were not sizing as I would have liked when it came to mobile, but eventually I got them figured out. I really enjoyed adding and modifying the Bootstrap elements, but I admit that my page
                leaves a bit to be desired in terms of css bling and layout. I was happy when it ran through the <a
                  class="blogLink" href="https://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">validator</a> for the first time only having two issues and one warning, all of which I easily corrected. </p>

              <p>The second week was the introduction to JavaScript. I enjoyed the <a class="blogLink"
                  href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_exercises.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools JavaScript
                  Exercises</a> and also
                the <a class="blogLink" href="https://www.learn-js.org" target="_blank">Learn JS interactive JavaScript
                  tutorial</a>
                as I do better with hands on learning verses just reading.</p>

              <p>This week was comprised of several exercises. On first go, it mainly involved finding existing code online and then modifying it to suit the specifications. While it was certainly speedy, eventually it left kind of bitter taste in that I only changed things, when I knew that I should have been trying to create it from scratch. While even starting was so overwhelming, I decided with Exercise 4 - Calculator, it was time to jump off that cliff and give it a go. A fellow classmate, Adam, came to the same realization; and we decided to tackle the project in a pair programming way, though each on our own computers. We started out small, just doing one minor thing and making sure it worked before moving onto the next. It was immensely satisfying building something from the ground up, and each time a part of it worked, it was the best feeling ever. Next step will be to scrap and then figure out the css on my own.</p>

              <p>Once I survived creating that exercise from scratch, I knew that I was going to have to back and create the others from scratch as well. Hover over each image to see the title, and click to be taken to its respective GitHub code.</p>

              <p>My game changing moment was when the instructor helped me to implement borders on my grid. I am a very
                visual person, and being able to see the layout of each of the many rows and columns on my page was wonderful.
                It helped me to easily make changes and know that I was on the right path. Best thing ever! I will implement this
                every time as it's simple to add and remove in just the css without having to do anything to the HTML.</p>

              <p>So far, this blog page has been updated with two JavaScript functions. The first is the ability to Show/Hide my Nav bar at the top of the page with a button click. The second is to personalize the 'Welcome' text under the main image with your name with an addional button click.</p>

              <p>One thing I need to work on going forward is making sure that I am, at the very least, committing myproject changes at the end of each day. For Exercise 5 - Weather App, I only committed at the end of theproject, after three days! I was fortunate that nothing happened to my computer otherwise all of my hard work would have been gone.

              <p>This week was the introduction to Project Two, creating a Restaurant menu by pulling from a API that produced a random set of food descriptions. I enjoyed using the Bootstrap Accordion feature to show and hid my menu sections. I was very happy with how it turned out, though I understand it will need to be updated to involve JavaScript/VueJS injections going forward. I was so happy with it, that my blog now features an Accordion! Also I just found this <a class="blogLink" href="https://scotch.io/courses/getting-started-with-vue/vue-events-building-an-accordion" target="_blank">VueJS accordion tutorial</a> to help me to better build this site going forward (just not today).</p>

              <p>After the second project, we were tasked to create a website that could read your mind! After being completed in JavaScript, Mind Reader was the first exercise to be redone in VueJS. It wasn't as bad as I was thinking, and for the most part the JavaScript in the original was implemented as is within the Vue set up. In Github the main branch is the original JavaScript and then there is a VueJS branch which is linked below. Towards the end of the week was our first full VueJS exercise: Exercise 7 - To-Do List. It was quite the undertaking, but it was very thrilling when something worked correctly. The dev branch has the progress so far.</p>

              <p>This week found us continuing to dive into VueJS. <a class="postLink" href="https://github.com/EllerMel/exercise1-js-digital-clock/tree/vueJS" target="_blank">Exercise 1 - Digital Clock</a> was successfully refactored into VueJS. At first, due to the the interval aspect, we were not able to figure out how to make the clock it's own component. But upon further research and discussion, it was finally figured out. Both the date and the clock from that exercise is now located near the top of this blog page.</p>
              <p>I was extremely excited when the morning warm-ups were <a class="blogLink" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql" target="_blank">MySQL</a> on Thursday. I was a Data Analyst for over three years, and I really love the process of writing queries to return data. I am looking forward to when we get to the Database aspect of the course.</p>
              <p>The last half of the week was the splitting of the class into two teams. My group is: The A-Team and it is comprised of myself, Colby, Shawn and Kseniya. Our project is designing a website for the mock company of: Road-Runner Exotic Car Rental. I think once we get it going, it will not be as daunting as it is seems right now. There is just a large gap between what we know how to do and what we would like to do. There are things that I know I could easily manage if I just had access to a database and could whip up some stored procedures. I think once we get it figured out for one instance in VueJS, it should be easy to implement on the rest of the site. I have been battling with a cold all week, and it has certainly been a bit more of a struggle, but I am hoping over this weekend I will be able to rest and reset.</p>

              <br>
              <p>All week consisted of working on our group projects. It was certainly a process of creating the MVP, personas and stories for an entire site. We had our very first go at installing vue cli, vue bootstrap, jquery, vue router and vuex all on a project. The entire process was a big learning curve leaving many of us feeling like we were suddenly pushed off a cliff we thought we were successfully climbing. My two initial stories involved building a subscription modal and a login modal. I had to find a fix to be able to prompt a modal to open via the navbar without the href triggering a page reload and thus resetting the showModal status I set. I was also able to figure out some verification checking on the modal upon submit, but I still felt like I wasn't really challenging myself. Then I created a review form on the car details page and set that up so that on submit it actually displayed on the page, verses my two other forms that (other then the verification checking on the one) didn't actually do anything. I enjoyed that. At the end of the day on Thursday I decided to pick up two should have stories and created an Admin page with a feature to add additional cars. I was able to use Colby's car card and duplicate it so the 'Rent' button could be an 'Edit' button instead, and I created a modal to edit the car information. I wish we would have had a few more days as I think we could have really created some great things. Like I wonder if the car card could have been set up to have the 'Rent' or 'Edit' button appear so that it could be used in both places. Lastly on Friday morning, Justin was nice to offer to come in early so anyone who wanted some additional help could get it. Friday morning I was able to work through setting up the basics for Local Storage on the project with him. Due to issues with the group still trying to sort out getting the specific car details to appear on a separate page, I decided to use Local Storage instead for the users and it was extremely satisfying when I got it to work. I really loved what we were able to accomplish in the short time with a steep learning curve. Kseniya worked really hard to style the page to give it a good color scheme and to make sure that all the elements resized appropriately for mobile. I think our team worked really great together and we were good at communicating and helping each other to get the process done together. I felt like I became more comfortable with a lot of the aspects of building a site, and I think that I was a beneficial asset to the team through out the whole process which was a fantastic feeling. I look forward forking the repo and continuing to work on the site on my own. I would like to implement the cars on Local Storage that I set up, but commented out due to time. I want to pass the car information to the edit modal. I want to have the new car form check to see if any other vehicles match that one before adding. I would like to put the check box for the featured cars on the car edit form and have it actually change the featured status and update those cars accordingly. We ran into a few hiccups trying to get the project up to Heroku, so I will just post some super awesome screenshots below and a link to the repo.</p>

              <p>I can't believe that we are already five weeks into the bootcamp. I have learned so much and I am feeling so much more comfortable and confident with programming.
