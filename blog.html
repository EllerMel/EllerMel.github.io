        The first week began with a lot of tutorials (such as <a class="blogLink" href="https://learngitbranching.js.org"
          target="_blank">Learning Git</a>) and struggling with the <a class="blogLink" href="https://lab.github.com/"
          target="_blank">Github bot</a> and it ended with the setting up of <a class="blogLink"
          href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">MAMP</a> and <a class="blogLink"
          href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, which were both new to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The morning <a class="blogLink" href="https://www.hackerrank.com" target="_blank">Hacker Rank</a> exercises were
        something I was looking forward to, as I have heard that whiteboard problems are prevalent in interviews, and it is
        important to me to be able to learn how to work through them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was excited when we started on our first project, a campaign page for a fictional character, in which I chose
        Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I had a really fun time combining all the <a class="blogLink"
          href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> elements I learned about
        during the course of the week into a cohesive site (and getting to reference Buffy pictures and information). I had
        some elements on my page that were not sizing as I would have liked when it came to mobile, but eventually I got
        them figured out. I really enjoyed adding and modifying the Bootstrap elements, but I admit that my page leaves a
        bit to be desired in terms of css bling and layout. I was happy when it ran through the <a class="blogLink"
          href="https://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">validator</a> for the first time only having two issues and one
        warning, all of which I easily corrected. </p>
      <p>My site can can be viewed:</p>

      <p>The second week was the introduction to JavaScript. I enjoyed the <a class="blogLink"
          href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_exercises.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools JavaScript Exercises</a> and also
        the <a class="blogLink" href="https://www.learn-js.org" target="_blank">Learn JS interactive JavaScript tutorial</a>
        as I do better with hands on learning verses just reading.</p>
    
      <p>This week was comprised of several exercises. On first go, it mainly involved finding existing code online and then
        modifying it to suit the specifications. While it was certainly speedy, eventually it left kind of bitter taste in
        that I only changed things, when I knew that I should have been trying to create it from scratch. While the thought of
        even starting was so overwhelming, I decided with Exercise 4 - Calculator, it was time to jump off that cliff
        and give it a go. A fellow classmate, Adam, came to the same realization; and we decided to tackle the project in a
        pair programming way, though each on our own computers. We started out small, just doing one minor thing and making
        sure it worked before moving onto the next. It was immensely satisfying building something from the ground up, and
        each time a part of it worked, it was the best feeling ever. Next step will be to scrap and then figure out the css on my own.</p>
    
      <p>Once I survived creating that exercise from scratch, I knew that I was going to have to back and create the others
        from scratch as well. Hover over each image to see the title, and click to be taken to its respective GitHub code.</p>

      <p>My game changing moment was when the instructor helped me to implement borders on my grid. I am a very visual
        person, and being able to see the layout of each of the many rows and columns on my page was wonderful. It helped
        me to easily make changes and know that I was on the right path. Best thing ever! I will implement this every time
        as it's simple to add and remove in just the css without having to do anything to the HTML.</p>

      <p>So far, this blog page has been updated with two JavaScript functions. The first is the ability to Show/Hide my Nav bar at the top of the page with a button click. The second is to personalize the 'Welcome' text under the main image with your name with an addional button click.</p>

      <p>One thing I need to work on going forward is making sure that I am, at the very least, committing my project
        changes at the end of each day. For Exercise 5 - Weather App, I only committed at the end of the project, after
        three days! I was fortunate that nothing happened to my computer otherwise all of my hard work would have been gone.
